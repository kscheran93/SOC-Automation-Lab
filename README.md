## Malicious Website
SquareX combines rules-based methods, heuristic analysis, and machine learning algorithms to continuously monitor web traffic patterns and user interactions. This combination is designed to identify and block potential online threats in real time within the browser. In addition to these proactive measures, SquareX also employs isolation technology. This technology is used when a user wishes to access a website that has been flagged as suspicious. The isolation solution creates a secure, separate environment where the user can view the website without exposing their system to potential risks. This environment acts as a containment area, preventing any potentially malicious content from affecting the user's device. This dual approach allows SquareX to provide effective online protection while giving users the option to safely explore websites that may pose a risk. Most of these features will only be available with our enterprise edition.

## Malicious Files
SquareX combats malicious files through its advanced in-browser scanning technology. Whenever a user receives an email attachment or downloads a file from a website, SquareX conducts a thorough examination right within the browser. With its capability to detect maldocs, SquareX offers robust protection against document-based threats such as malicious macros and other embedded active content. This approach is also privacy-centric, as it ensures no user data is transmitted to external servers. Complementing this, SquareX's cloud-based isolation creates a secure environment for safely viewing files from unknown senders or ones which are marked by our analysis as potentially malicious. Most of these features will only be available with our enterprise edition.

## Disposable Email
Temporary, anonymous, and secure email inboxes. Eliminate spam, unwanted ads, and malicious threats!

## Malicious Content
SquareX deploys machine learning algorithms optimised to run in the browser to effectively detect and block malicious content. Whether dealing with deceptive ads, phishing emails, or business email compromise, this in-browser technology enables SquareX to thoroughly analyse threats and safeguard users against various forms of fraud and scams. Importantly, this approach also ensures that user privacy is maintained, as all analysis is conducted within the confines of the user's browser. Most of these features will only be available with our enterprise edition.

## Malicious Networks
SquareX safeguards users' online presence from malicious networks by shielding them from threats like compromised DNS, malicious proxies, and risks from public Wi-Fi networks. Through a combination of rules-based methods, heuristic analysis, and machine learning algorithms, we detect and inform users about potential network threats in real-time. Our secured remote browser isolation method ensures users' browsing experience remains secure, even in the most insecure network environments. Most of these features will only be available with our enterprise edition.
